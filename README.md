# AML-Fall-2019
Project repository/page for CS5824/ECE5424 - Advanced Machine Learning project. 

This page lists down the observations and results performed as a part of the project under **CS5824/ECE5424 Advanced Machine Learning** in Fall 2019 under *Prof. Dr. Bert Huang*. This project attempts to reproduce a finding from a Machine Learning Research study and present the results of the same.

## ABCNN: Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentence Pairs
The [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05193.pdf) asserts that Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform better than CNNs without attention mechanisms. The paper integrated attention into CNNs for sentence pair modelling. Sentence pair modelling is a critical task in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Answer Selection, Paraphrase Identification and Textual Entailment. The experiments were performed for these three tasks. For this project, we are going to focus on Answer Selection.
